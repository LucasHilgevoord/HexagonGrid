# Hexagon Grid

A hexagon figure being used in a grid with possible further mechanics.

## Features
- [Demo](www.lucashilgevoord.com/demo/HexagonGrid)

## Software Anaylse 
The software that has been used in this project is the Unity Engine with the C# language.<br>
I tried using Javascript in the beginning of the project because it seemed easier to create lines and implant the small math formula and that was indeed the outcome.<br>
Then I made the choice to switch to Unity so I would be able to learn a bit more about how it could be made within unity with the uses of meshes. I am also using unity a lot more then HTML, that didn't change the fact that I wanted to learn more in html but knowing how to do it in unity is also great.

## Learning goals 
- Possible ways to use hexagons.
- How do meshes work within unity.
- Pythagorean theorem.
- Using formulas in code.

## Schedule 
- Monday: How do hexagons work and how to use them.
- Tuesday: Creating hexagons in Javascript.
- Wednesday: Creating grid with hexagons in Javascript.
- Thursday: Creating hexagons in Unity.
- Friday: Creating hexagon grid in Unity.
